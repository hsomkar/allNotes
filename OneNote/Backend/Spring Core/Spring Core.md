## Spring

 - It is a Dependency Injection based Java Application Framework. - Some features of spring framework: 
    
    - Lightweight
    - Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
        
        - It is used for separating cross-cutting concerns (for example, logging, security, etc.) from the business logic of the application.
    - Transaction Management
        
        - This is used to unify several transaction management APIs and is used to coordinate transactions for Java objects.
    - Spring container
    - Dependency Injection
    - Integration With Other Frameworks
      
    
- Some of the advantages of using Spring Framework are:
    
    - Reducing direct dependencies between different components of the application.
    - Writing unit test cases are easy in Spring framework.
    - Reduces the amount of boiler-plate code, such as initializing objects, open/close resources.
    - Spring framework is divided into several modules.
    - It gives a platform to developer for developing applications.
      
    
- To work with Spring core we need ‘spring-core’ and ‘spring-context’ dependencies.
