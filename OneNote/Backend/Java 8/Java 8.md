- Significant reason for introducing JAVA 8 was to introduce Conciseness in the code.
- JAVA brings in Functional programming which is enabled by Lambda expressions (a powerful tool to create concise code base.)
- If you have ever observed, with Python, Scala we can do the same thing in Very less LOC. By mid 20s JAVA lost a large market due to these languages. To prevent further loss java upgraded itself from Only OOPs language to some concepts of FP to create concise code base.
- New Features : 
    - Lambda Expression
    - Stream API
    - Default methods in the interface
    - Static methods
    - Functional Interface
    - Optional
    - Method references
    - Date API
    - Nashorn, JavaScript Engine
- Main Advantages : 
    - Compact code (Less boiler plate code)
    - More readable and reusable code
    - More testable code
    - Parallel operations
