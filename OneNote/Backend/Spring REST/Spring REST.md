- **Spring REST** is one of the modules of Spring framework, using which we can build ‘Restfull web Application’. - A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. - That data can be used to ==GET==, ==PUT==, ==POST== and ==DELETE== data types, which refers to the ==reading==, ==updating==, ==creating== and ==deleting== of operations concerning resources. - In the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), typically links on the Web. - One application communicates with other program with the help of APIs. - Types of API
    
    - Open APIs - They are also known as external or public APIs, are available to developers and other users with minimal restrictions.
    - Internal APIs - These are usually designed for internal use within a company.
    - Partner APIs - A developer needs specific rights or licenses in order to access this type of API because they are not available to the public.
    - Composite APIs - This type of API combines different data and service APIs.
      
    
- Dependencies needed:
    
    - spring-web, spring-web-mvc, jackson-databind, jackson-core, jackson-dataformat-xml.
      
    
- In Spring REST data is shared by xml/json. - Spring REST or Spring Boot is called as SOA(Service oriented Architecture) - Using SOA Restfull web Application is built - We send or consume data in the form of xml/json
