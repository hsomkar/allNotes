There are three types of errors in programming:

1. Syntax Errors,
2. Runtime Errors, and
3. Logical Errors.  
- **Syntax Errors:** Syntax errors, also called parsing errors, occur at compile time in traditional programming languages and at interpret time in JavaScript. 
- **Runtime Errors:** Runtime errors, also called exceptions, occur during execution (after compilation/interpretation). 
- **Logical Errors:** Logic errors can be the most difficult type of errors to track down. These errors are not the result of a syntax or runtime error. Instead, they occur when you make a mistake in the logic that drives your script and you do not get the result you expected. 
- We can handle the Exceptions using **try...catch...finally** Statements 
- **Try** block: risky lines of codes which may result in exception will be written inside the try block 
- **Catch** block: used to handle the exception occurred in try block 
- **Finally** block: Code that is always executed regardless of an exception occurring
- **Throw:** used to throw the exception
    - throw( "Divide by zero error." );
